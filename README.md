Homework 4: ZipCode TextBox

Create a new WPF Project with a TextBox that only accepts:

US Zip Codes ##### or #####-####
Canadian Postal Codes: A#B#C#
The window contains a Submit button that is only enabled when a valid zip code or postal code is entered.

So for example, a user could enter 98122 or 98012-4444 or T1R2X4 and the Submit button would be enabled.

The Submit button does not need to perform any action.
